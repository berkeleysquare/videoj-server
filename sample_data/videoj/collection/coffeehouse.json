The lyrics were originally in French; an English version was created in 1906. Robert Stanley Weir wrote in 1908 another English version, which is the official and most popular version, one that is not a literal translation of the French. Weir\u0027s lyrics have been revised twice, taking their present form in 1980, but the French lyrics remain unaltered. \"O Canada\" had served as a de facto national anthem since 1939, officially becoming Canada\u0027s national anthem in 1980 when the Act of Parliament making it so received royal assent and became effective on July 1 as part of that year\u0027s Dominion Day (now known as Canada Day) celebrations.","ensemble":"jk_solo","media":"OCanada.mp4","composer":"","copyright":"0","poster":"OCanada.jpg","recorded":"2017-05-15"},{"id":2810,"title":"Who Can I Turn To?","description":"Two life lessons from today\u0027s selection: 1.
